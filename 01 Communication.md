# Communication Principles

### 1. Information Representation

- **Bit**: The smallest unit of data (0 or 1).
- **Code**: Maps bit combinations to characters or data values.
  - **Standards**: 
    - **ASCII**: 7-bit code for English characters.
    - **Unicode**: 32-bit code supporting multiple languages and symbols.

### 2. Signals

- **Media Types**: Copper cables, optical fiber, or wireless.
- **Analog Signals**: Continuously varying, as seen in audio waves.
- **Digital Signals**: Discrete, as seen in computer data transmission.

### 3. Properties of Periodic Signals

- **Amplitude**: Strength of the signal, measured in volts or decibels.
- **Frequency (f)**: Cycles per second (Hz), describing how often the wave oscillates.
- **Phase**: Position relative to a reference point.
- **Wavelength (λ)**: Physical distance covered by one cycle of the wave.

### 4. Signal Theories

- **Fourier Series**: Any periodic signal can be represented by a combination of sine waves.
- **Bandwidth**:
  - **Analog**: Range of frequencies a medium can handle.
  - **Digital**: Maximum bits per second transmittable over a medium.
- **Baud Rate**: Number of signal changes per second.
- **Data Rate**: Rate of data transfer (bps - bits per second).

### 5. Sampling and Theorems

- **Nyquist Theorem**: Sampling rate must be at least twice the highest frequency to reconstruct the signal.
- **Shannon’s Theorem**: Maximum data rate depends on bandwidth and the signal-to-noise ratio.
